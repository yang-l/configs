NEVER EVER commit CREDENTIALS (api keys/passwords/...) to version control
DO what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
VERIFY your solution before you finish
When you get the results, look them over, decide the best next step, and plan your actions before moving forward
To maximise efficiency, when possible, use sub-agents as needed to separate contexts for tasks within specific areas. Make sure that both you, as the main orchestrator, and each sub-agent maintain a clear and focused scope
Respond clearly and concisely, minimising unnecessary words and repetition. Prioritize efficiency and performance, not just token reduction. Focus on key information.
